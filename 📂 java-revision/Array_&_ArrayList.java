datatype{] variable_name = new datatype
// syntax :
    datatype[] variable_name = new datatype[size];
	int[] var1 = new int[5]; // this line means that the reference variable "var1" is pointing an array object that ype is integer.
	// or directly
	int[] var2 = {23, 6, 78, 10, 23};

So what is actually happening is:
	1. int[] var1 : this is the declaration of array. var1 is getting defined in the stack. and also this thing happened at "COMPILE" Time.
	2. new int[5] : this is the initialisation: actualy object is created is here in the heap memory. and this happened at "RUNTIME". and this is called "DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION" where this array created at runtime.And this "new" keyword is used to create an object in heap memory.
and Heap Objects that are not "CONTINOUS" in Java. Internally Array is not continous in JAVA, basically depends on JVM.

Introduction: The Significance of Arrays in Programming

This chapter begins with an introduction to arrays, one of the fundamental data structures in programming, especially in Java. Arrays serve as a collection of elements of the same data type, enabling efficient storage and management of multiple values. Their significance lies in organizing data compactly, which is vital for numerous programming tasks such as storing multiple roll numbers or names without declaring separate variables for each value.
Key vocabulary and concepts introduced include:

Array: A data structure that holds a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.
# Primitive vs Object data types: Arrays can store either primitives (like int, boolean) or objects (like String or user-defined classes).
# Syntax of arrays: Declaration, initialization, and accessing elements.
# Dynamic memory allocation: Memory for the array is allocated at runtime in the Heap.
# Reference variable: A variable that points to the array object in memory.
# Indexing: Arrays use zero-based indexing to access elements.
# This foundational knowledge is critical for understanding how arrays work internally, how to manipulate them, and why they are essential in programming.

Section 1: What Are Arrays and Why Do We Need Them?

Initially, the need for arrays is motivated through practical examples such as storing multiple roll numbers. Manually declaring variables like int rollNumber1, int rollNumber2, etc., becomes inefficient and unscalable, especially when the number of elements grows (e.g., storing 500 roll numbers).
Key points:

1. Arrays solve the problem of storing collections of homogeneous data by grouping them under a single data structure.
2. Arrays must contain elements of the same data type; mixing types is not allowed. For example, an int[] array cannot contain strings or booleans.
3. The syntax for declaring an array includes specifying the data type followed by square brackets, e.g., int[] rollNumbers;
4. Initialization involves the new keyword to allocate memory, e.g., rollNumbers = new int[5];
Bullet points:

>> Arrays provide a compact way to represent multiple variables of the same type.
>> Data type consistency is mandatory in arrays.
>> Declaration creates a reference variable on the stack, while new creates the array object in the Heap.
>> Arrays are fixed in size once declared.
	
Section 2: Array Syntax and Memory Management in Java

The session delves deeper into the syntax and memory model of arrays in Java. An array declaration creates a reference variable stored in the stack memory, while the actual array object is created in the Heap memory during runtime via the new keyword.
Important points:

1. The array reference (int[] arr) is stored in stack memory.
2. The actual array object (holding the elements) is stored in the Heap.
3. The new keyword triggers dynamic memory allocation — allocating memory during runtime rather than compile time.
4. Java’s memory is divided into stack (for reference variables, function call frames) and Heap (for objects including arrays).
5. Arrays in Java may not be allocated in continuous memory blocks as in languages like C++. This depends on the JVM implementation.
6. The Java Language Specification (JLS) states that Heap objects are not guaranteed to be contiguous, which means array elements may not be stored in continuous addresses in memory.
Bullet points:

>> Declaration (int[] arr) → creates a reference variable in stack.
>> Initialization (arr = new int[5]) → allocates memory for 5 integers in Heap.
>> Java arrays are objects and reside in Heap, unlike primitives which reside mostly in stack.
>> JVM controls memory allocation, so continuity of array memory is not guaranteed in Java.
>> Dynamic memory allocation occurs at runtime, enabling flexibility but with some overhead.
	
Section 3: Array Indexing and Default Values

The concept of array indexing is introduced: arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 
0
0, second at 
1
1, and so forth.
Key insights:

1. Accessing or modifying elements uses syntax like arr[index].
2. Attempting to access an index outside the declared bounds results in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
3. When an array is created, elements of primitive arrays (e.g., int[]) are initialized to default values (e.g., 0 for integers).
4. Arrays of objects (non-primitives) initialize elements to null because these are references to objects that currently point to no instance.
Additional notes on null:

=> null is a special literal in Java, representing the absence of an object reference.
=> It can be assigned only to reference types (e.g., String, Array, custom objects), not primitives.
=> By default, uninitialized reference variables hold the value null.
Bullet points:

>> Array indices start at zero.
>> Default values for integer array elements: zero; for object references: null.
>> null is a special literal indicating no object.
>> Accessing invalid indices throws runtime errors.
	
Section 4: Arrays of Objects and Internal Representation

Arrays can also hold objects rather than primitives. For example, an array of String objects stores references to String instances in the Heap.
How this works internally:

1. The array in Heap stores reference variables pointing to actual objects, which may be scattered in the Heap.
2. Each element of the array is a reference pointing to a distinct object.
3. Until explicitly initialized, these references are null.
4. This explains why printing an uninitialized String[] shows null values.
Bullet points:

>> Object arrays store references to objects.
>> Elements are references stored contiguously in the array, but actual objects may be scattered in Heap.
>> Uninitialized references are null by default.
>> Primitives and objects have distinct memory handling in Java.
	
Section 5: Taking Input and Printing Arrays Using Loops

The process of populating arrays with input and printing them is demonstrated with loops.
Key concepts:

1. Use a for loop to iterate through array indices for input and output.
2. The array’s .length property provides the size of the array, useful for loop bounds.
3. Java provides an enhanced for loop (for-each loop) to iterate elements directly, improving code readability.
4. The standard Arrays.toString() method from the java.util.Arrays class converts arrays to a formatted string representation, simplifying output.
Bullet points:

>> Use for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) for index-based input/output.
>> Use enhanced for loop: for (int num : arr) to iterate elements directly.
>> Use Arrays.toString(arr) for printing arrays as strings.
>> Accessing out-of-bounds index results in runtime error.
	
Section 6: Multi-Dimensional Arrays – Structure and Memory

The chapter explains 2D arrays (and by extension multi-dimensional arrays) as arrays of arrays.
Internal structure:

1. The main array contains references to other arrays (rows).
2. These sub-arrays can have different lengths, allowing "jagged" arrays.
3. Only the number of rows is mandatory when declaring a 2D array; the number of columns per row can vary.
4. Memory allocation for each sub-array happens separately in the Heap.
5. Accessing an element requires two indices: arr[row][col].
6. Input and output involve nested loops iterating over rows and columns.
Bullet points:

>> 2D arrays are arrays of 1D arrays (rows).
>> Rows can have variable length; columns per row are not fixed.
>> Memory is allocated separately for each row array in Heap.
>> Use nested loops for input/output: outer loop over rows, inner loop over columns.
>> Jagged arrays allow flexible row sizes.

Section 7: Passing Arrays to Functions and Mutability

Arrays in Java exhibit mutable behavior when passed into functions.
Key insights:

1. Java passes references by value: a copy of the reference to the array is passed to the function.
2. Modifications to array elements inside the function affect the original array, as both reference variables point to the same object.
3. Arrays are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed.
4. In contrast, Strings are immutable (cannot be changed once created).
5. This mutability allows in-place operations like swapping or reversing.
Bullet points:

>> Passing arrays passes a copy of the reference, not a copy of the array.
>> Changes inside the function reflect in the original array.
>> Arrays are mutable; strings are immutable.
>> Supports efficient in-place algorithms.
Section 8: ArrayList – Dynamic Arrays in Java

Java's ArrayList class offers a dynamic alternative to fixed-size arrays.
Why ArrayList?

1. Arrays have fixed sizes defined at creation.
2. When the size is unknown or variable, ArrayList automatically resizes.
3. Similar to C++ vectors, part of Java’s Collection Framework.
Usage and syntax:

>> Declared as ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
>> Generic type parameter ensures type safety (only specified type elements allowed).
>> Cannot store primitives directly, only their wrapper classes (Integer for int).
>> Supports convenient methods: add(), get(), set(), remove(), contains(), etc.
>> Can iterate using loops or enhanced for loops.

Internal working:

*Internally backed by an array.
*When capacity is exceeded, it creates a new larger array (commonly double size), copies old elements, and discards the old array.
*This resizing is amortized constant time for additions.
*Capacity management is abstracted away from the user.
Bullet points:

>> ArrayList provides dynamic sizing.
>> Must specify the generic type; only objects allowed (no primitives).
>> Internally backed by arrays with automatic resizing.
>> Supports rich API for adding, accessing, updating, and removing elements.
>> Capacity doubles when threshold reached to maintain efficiency.
>> Section 9: Multi-Dimensional ArrayLists

Multi-dimensional ArrayLists are ArrayLists of ArrayLists (e.g., ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>).
Key points:

1. Must initialize inner ArrayLists explicitly before adding elements.
2. Each inner list can have different sizes (similar to jagged multi-dimensional arrays).
3. Supports dynamic resizing at each level.
4. Requires nested loops for input/output.
Bullet points:

>> Multi-dimensional ArrayLists allow flexible, dynamic multi-dimensional structures.
>> Initialization of inner lists is mandatory to avoid NullPointerException.
>> Inner lists can vary in size independently.

Section 10: Sample Algorithms and Practice Problems

Several basic algorithms illustrate arrays’ utility:
Swap Elements

Swap values at two indices using a temporary variable.
Demonstrates mutability of arrays when passed to functions.
Find Maximum Element

Iterate through the array to find the largest element overall or within a specific index range.
Edge cases include empty arrays or invalid ranges.
Reverse an Array using Two Pointers

Use two pointers (start and end) moving inward, swapping elements until pointers meet or cross.
Efficient in-place reversal.
Bullet points:

Arrays allow implementation of common algorithms easily.
Functions can modify arrays directly due to reference passing.
Two-pointer technique is a fundamental pattern for array manipulation.
Edge cases should be handled carefully, such as empty arrays or invalid indices.
