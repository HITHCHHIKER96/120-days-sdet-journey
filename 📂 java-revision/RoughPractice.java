    // Now lets see 2D Arrays:
    int[][] arr = new int[][]; // so here is [][] defined by 2d arrays and most important is when the initialisation part happened first [] is for row and second [] is for coloumn and the first one size you have to define as it is mandatory, but the second one is not mandatory.
    like int[][] arr1 = new in[2][]; // you can left the size blank for coloumn but for row you have to define it.
    int[][] arr1 = {
        {1, 2, 3}, // assume this ia an array of index 0,
        {2, 5, 7} // this is an array of index 2.
    }; // It is basically an arrays of arrays.
